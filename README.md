# TechStack

This is a tutorial Application build by following the online [Udemy guide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course) by Stephen Grider.


The goal of the app is to show a list of technologies. When a user selects one the technologies, the card expands displaying a description of the selected
Tech.

# What did I accomplish

The goal of the app was to build it using React-native in conjuction with Redux. So I learned:

* How to init a React-native application,
* How to compile and bundle the application and run it on an ios-, or android simulator,
* How to handle Lifecycle events,
* How to display a list of items in a memory efficient way using the [React-native ListView](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html),
* How to init and link a Redux store and reducers,
* How to use Redux reducers and implement actions
* How to link the actions to a React-native Component using MapStateToProps,
* How to add animations on Components.
